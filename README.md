# How  to Draw the Thumbprint of God

This is the source code to a video tutorial that teaches you how to
write code to generate a visual rendering of the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

*Note: the source code is provided here only as a reference. 
It's highly recommended that you write the code yourself. 
In my opinion, you don't get the full experience unless you do so.*
